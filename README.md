# 🔥 Forest Fire Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of **forest fires in Algeria** using **machine learning**. It analyzes environmental factors such as **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and fire indices** to provide early warnings and assist in wildfire prevention.

## 📌 Features
- 🚀 **Machine Learning Model** predicts wildfire risks with **90% accuracy**.
- 🌎 **Uses Algerian Forest Fire Dataset** for analysis.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.
- 📊 **User inputs environmental data** and gets instant predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on the **Algerian Forest Fires Dataset**, sourced from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Algerian Forest Fire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitinchoudhary012/algerian-forest-fires-dataset)  

**Key Features in the Dataset:**
- **Temperature (°C)**
- **Humidity (%)**
- **Wind Speed (km/h)**
- **Rainfall (mm)**
- **Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)**
- **Duff Moisture Code (DMC)**
- **Drought Code (DC)**
- **Initial Spread Index (ISI)**
- **Buildup Index (BUI)**
- **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**
